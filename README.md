# Cloud computing environments to support data science teaching in health - data quality assessment

Author: Ioana Dumitrescu

The purpose of this project is to establish the data quality of a given dataset and then to provide suggestions on how to improve it.

In order to start using the notebook, upload the data set using either of the 2 provided methods:
1. Direct upload - change the value of the `file_path` variable to the file path of the desired data set
1. Use the upload widget - select the file that you want to upload

After that, if you have used the upload widget, run the cell named "Validating data upload" so that the content of the selected file will be extracted.

You can also visualize a preview of the data set as a confirmation that you have indeed uploaded the correct file. 

The following techniques are used for assessing the quality of the data set:
1. General data set metadata - shows some descriptive and structural metadata that offer users some general insights about the content of the data and its structure.

1. Values distribution for a specific column - select a column that you would like to
